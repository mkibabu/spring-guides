# MESSAGING WITH JMS

Project that publishes and subscribes to messages using the Java Message Service
(JMS). JMS is an API that allows applications to create, send and receive messages.
It provides a reliable, asynchronous messaging protocol for applications. A JMS
application consists of the following parts:
* A JMS *provider* is a messaging system that implements the JMS interfaces and
provides admin and control features.
* JMS *clients* that produce messages.
* *Messages* that package information to be sent between clients
* *Administered objects*, such as destinations and connection factories.
